  <h1>The Ender Relay</h1>
  
</div>

This is an implementation of the [ender relay concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1i4izl25V4) a youtuber by the name of Kenadian made, for Forge 1.19.2

The resources for the block were provided by Kenadian, and altered by me.

The Ender Relay is a block that can only be used in the end, it is crafted with a lodestone compass and can be charged like a respawn anchor, instead with an ender pearl. When a player clicks the block, it teleports to the lodestone compasses location, ontop of the lodestone.

This completes the trilogy of the bed, respawn anchor by introducing a transportation item for the end dimension.

For more on the concept and the mod, watch the video linked above! (Note that the charging material has been changed from end crystals to ender pearls)
