# The Ender Relay

This is a one-to-one replica of the [ender relay concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1i4izl25V4) a youtuber by the name of Kenadian made.

The resources for the block were provided by Kenadian.

The Ender Relay is a block that can only be used in the end, it is crafted with a lodestone compass and can be charged like a respawn anchor, instead with a end crystal. When a player clicks the block, it teleports to the lodestone compasses location, ontop of the lodestone.

This completes the trilogy of the bed, respawn anchor by introducing a transportation item for the end dimension.

For more on the concept (and the mod, since its a 1:1), watch the video linked above!
